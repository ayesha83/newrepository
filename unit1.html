            <h1>IT & Technology Outcomes</h1>
            <h2 id="unit11">1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h2>

            <p class="sub-paragraph answer">IT plays an integral role in every industry. It helps companies improve business
                processes,
                achieve cost efficiencies, drive revenue growth and maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace.
                Information technology can speed up the time it takes new products to reach the market.
                Companies rely on IT for fast communications, data processing and market intelligence. </p>

            <h2 id="unit12">1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects
                successfully</h2>

            <p class="sub-paragraph answer">In order to make a digital project successful we need following.
                A vision of the product, which comes from the sponsor of the project.
                A development, which will translate the vision of the sponsor to a software art-effect.
                A UX/ Design team, which will make sure the digital product is of high quality and easy to use.
                A QA team, which will make sure that digital products have all the functionality as per the vision
                of the product sponsor. Collaboration tools will help the digital team to communicate in a productive
                manner.
                Slack is a well adopted tool. </p>

            <h2 id="unit13">1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT </h2>

            <p class="sub-paragraph answer">Planning and the execution of the project will be done using the Agile methods.
                Task will be worked on in an Agile Sprints. To manage the Sprints tools like
                Trello will be used. The link to my trello is https://trello.com/b/8f9MPZM3/website</p>

            <h2 id="unit14">1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects</h2>
            <p class="sub-paragraph answer">One of the biggest risk or a digital project is the scope creep, which will lead
                the
                project to not finish on time. If the user feedback is not taken regularly during the
                development of digital product, we may end up with a product which doesn’t solve the given problem. </p>

            <h2 id="unit15">1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software</h2>
            <p class="sub-paragraph answer">Every digital project is different from the last one, hence you have to choose the
                tools according to the nature of the project. You should always consider choosing the
                tools which are widely adopted by the market. </p>

            <h2 id="unit16">1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve
                your outcomes</h2>
            <p class="sub-paragraph answer">You need to choose the right technology for the task you are trying to solve. I
                have used Trello and
                Github and they have helped me many times.
                Trello lets you organise the work collaboratively.
                Github gives a platform for all the team members to access and alter the code.
                Slack is a communication tool, which help the team members to communcate with one another.</p>

            <h2 id="unit17">1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects</h2>
            <p class="sub-paragraph answer">It is important to know that the internet has certain laws and regulations, which
                includes
                constraints on uploading and downloading, copyrights, licence, child protection.
                In 1995 GDPR came into legal force and it has far-reaching impacts on individuals and
                organisations in all sectors globally. The GDPR is the EU’s way of giving individuals,
                prospects, customers, contractors and employees more power over their data and less power
                to the organisations that collect and use such data for monetary gain.One of the aim of
                GDPR was to protect individuals’ personal data.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="sub-paragraph answer">
                The IT tools that I have used to make my website are Visual Studio Code, Github and Trello. Visual
                Studio Code provides basic support for HTML programming out of the box. Trello helped me in organizing
                my to do tasks and with Github i was able to upload and share my code online and was able to get some
                help where needed.
            </p>
            <h2 id="unit22">
                2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate 

            </h2>
            <p class="sub-paragraph answer">
                I have used Visual Studio Code to write my code aas it is highly customizable and it allowed
                me to change the colour theme accessing shortcuts. Working with CSS in javascript helped in
                styling the outlook og my website. I could make my website look prettier in working in css 
                Trello helped me in organizing my tasks efficiently and 
                effectively. I was able to split my tasks into segments and then acheiving them accordingly. Github helped
                me publishing my website online and with the help of github I could access my code from anywhere and could 
                make changes in it from anywhere.

                2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with
                your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the
                interests of openness. What would you change?
            </h2>
            <p class="sub-paragraph answer">

                Yes, I am happy with what I have made. I had learnt some skills over the past few days and implied them
                to make my own website. If i had got more time I would have learnt and tried more things i.e. adding
                more styling to the website. 


            </p>
            <h2 id="unit24">
                2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project
            </h2>
            <p class="sub-paragraph answer">
                I am working on adding links to my main website,i.e. Links to unit1 and unit 2. I want to improve the
                navigations more effectively. I am looking into swapping a text with another text, which requires some 
                javascript coding aswell. Will try to achieve that too. 


            </p>
            <h2 id="unit25">
                2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose
            </h2>
            <p class="sub-paragraph answer">
                I was trying to put the image and text side by side but it wasn't coming up properly. So i used flexbox to
                get the alignment and it helped. I was required to make a website with my personal information and 
                information about IT in units 1 and units 2 segments. I have achieved the tasks with the help of internet 
                and some bits with my own knowledge about IT.
